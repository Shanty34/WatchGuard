# Surveillance and Security System

This project is an enhanced surveillance system that utilizes React, Django, and Machine Learning to monitor a geographic area for unusual or suspicious behavior. The system quickly detects and alerts authorities about potential threats, enabling a swift and coordinated response.

## Features

- Advanced detection algorithms for real-time monitoring and identification of suspicious activities
- Instant notifications via WhatsApp or other communication channels for quick decision-making
- User-friendly React interface for easy interaction and monitoring
- Django backend for secure data storage and management
- Machine learning capabilities for continuous improvement and adaptation

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm
